# Kanban

## Kanban Virtual Scroll

Kanban stories are only rendered if they are in the viewport. For that we are using https://material.angular.io/cdk/scrolling/overview.

We have two scrolls, the horizontal for the kanban status and the vertical stories scrolls.

Angular cdk scroll doesn't work with dynamic height items, so we have our own scroll strategy `KanbanVirtualScrollStrategy`.

`KanbanVirtualScrollStrategy` receives `itemHeights` an array of heights to calculate the scroll size. `KanbanVirtualScrollStrategy` is going to use these heights until the real story is rendered, then is going to use the real one. `checkRenderedContentSize` is responsible for this calculation, the function run when the content changed.

The attribute `kanbanVirtualScrollStrategy` in `cdk-virtual-scroll-viewport` make this works.

Most of the `KanbanVirtualScrollStrategy` code is based in other `VirtualScrollStrategy`.

[Issue](https://github.com/angular/components/issues/10113). Angular have an experimental support for dynamic heights. We probably must use it when it's stable.

## Kanban status keyboard navigation

`KanbanStatusKeyboardNavigationDirective` capture arrow left/right keyboard events no navigate horizontally between statuses. Because we use virtual scroll the status is not always visible so is going to wait until is render to move the focus & scroll.

## Kanban story keyboard navigation

`KanbanStatusKeyboardNavigationDirective` capture keyboard arrows to move between stories. When the user navigate between story in different statuses, we make a live announce with the new status title.

## Horizontal scroll with drag & drop

`KanbanWorkflowComponent` use `KineticScrollService` for scrolling with momentum.

## Status column height

Angular cdk scroll needs a fixed height for the scroll, but we need a dynamic height because the `add story` button.

`StatusScrollDynamicHeightDirective` is going to observe the content and for every html change is going to calculate the new height without exceeding the maximum height available.

## Scroll to the new story

When a new story is created, it is stored in the global state. `KanbanStatusComponent` is watching for new stories in a status using `selectStatusNewStories(this.status.id)` and every time a new story is created the component run `scrollToStory`. The function `scrollToStory` is not easy because we don't render all the stories so the component scroll to bottom and then wait for 500ms for changes in the scrollStrategy height if there is any change then run again scroll bottom.

## D&D

The drag & drop is listening events in kanban-workflow.component.ts & animate the drop.
