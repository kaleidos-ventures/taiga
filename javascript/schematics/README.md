# Getting Started With Schematics

This repository is a basic Schematic implementation that serves as a starting point to create and publish Schematics to NPM.

### Testing

To test locally, install `@angular-devkit/schematics-cli` globally and use the `schematics` command line tool. That tool acts the same as the `generate` command of the Angular CLI, but also has a debug mode.

Check the documentation with
```bash
schematics --help
```

### Develop

```bash
npm i
npm run build-watch
```
