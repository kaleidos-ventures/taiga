    Middleware for reading or generating correlation IDs for each incoming request. Correlation IDs can then be
    added to the log traces, making it simple to retrieve all logs generated from a single HTTP request.

    When the middleware detects a correlation ID HTTP header in an incoming request, the ID is stored. If no header
    is found, a correlation ID (an UUID v4) is generated for the request instead.

    This middleware checks for the 'Correlation-ID' header by default.

    NOTE:
      [1] Remember to add "Correlation-ID" to 'allow_headers' and 'expose_headers' at the CORSMiddleware.

    This middleware is inspired by
      - https://github.com/snok/asgi-correlation-id
