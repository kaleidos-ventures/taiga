            it a unique name, and to make sure the module that defines this function
            is listed in the ``import_paths`` of the `procrastinate.App`.
        queue :
            The name of the queue in which jobs from this task will be launched, if
            the queue is not overridden at launch.
            Default is ``"default"``.

            queues.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : ``Optional[str]``
            Name of the worker. Will be passed in the `JobContext` and used in the logs

        queues : ``Iterable[str] | None``
            List of queues to listen to, or None to listen to every queue (defaults to
            ``None``).
        concurrency : ``int``
            Indicates how many asynchronous jobs the worker can run in parallel.
            Do not use concurrency if you have synchronous blocking tasks
            (defaults to ``1``).
        delete_jobs : ``DeleteJobStrategy``
            If ``DeleteJobStrategy.ALWAYS``, the worker will automatically delete all jobs

            If ``DeleteJobStrategy.SUCCESSFUL`` the worker will only delete successful jobs.
            If ``DeleteJobStrategy.NEVER``, the worker will keep the jobs in the database.
            (defaults to ``DeleteJobStrategy.NEVER``).
        wait : ``bool``
            If ``False``, the worker will terminate as soon as it has caught up with the
            queues. If ``True``, the worker will work until it is stopped by a signal.
