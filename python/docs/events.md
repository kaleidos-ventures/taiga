# Events

```
ws://localhost:8000/events/        # Example for a development environment
wss://taiga.domain.com/events/     # Example for a taiga api instance with SSL

### Channels

- `system` - channel for brodcast important messages for all the clients. [TODO]
- `users.<username>` - channel to publish all user events.
- `projects.<project_id>` - channel to publish all the project events. [TODO]
- `workspaces.<workspace_id>` - channel to publish all the workspace events. [TODO]


### Types and content schemas

We have common events types for C/U/D actions over the objets, the schema is:

```
<object_in_plural>.["create" | "update" |"delete"]
```

For example:

```
projects.create
projectinvitations.update
userstories.delete
```

We may have other actions if required; for example: `projectinvitations.revoke`.

We may also have events that affect only a subset of atributes of an object; for example `projects.permissions.update`.

We can send actions inside an event. The type must be `action` and the content should be an action described above.
