### Response

        "type": "<event-type>",
        "content": {...},
        "correlationId": "<correlation-id value>"
    }
}
```

### Channels

- `system` - channel for brodcast important messages for all the clients. [TODO]
- `users.<username>` - channel to publish all user events.
- `projects.<project_id>` - channel to publish all the project events. [TODO]
- `workspaces.<workspace_id>` - channel to publish all the workspace events. [TODO]


### Types and content schemas

- We have common events types for C/U/D actions over the objets, the schema is:
  ```
  <object_in_plural>.["create" | "update" |"delete"]
  ```
- And for generic objets, like comments or attachments, we use:
  ```
  <module>.<object_in_plural>.["create" | "update" |"delete"]
  ```
- We may have other actions if required; for example: `projectinvitations.revoke`.
- We may also have events that affect only a subset of atributes of an object; for example `projects.permissions.update`.
- We can send actions inside an event. The type must be `action` and the content should be an action described above.

For example:

```
projects.create
projects.permissions.update
projectinvitations.revoke
stories.delete
stories.comments.delete
```
