# Review check list

Check list for reviewing pull requests:
- models
- migrations (with descriptive name and proper index compared to main)
- api + validators
- services
- repositories
- events + documentation
- emails
- admin
- tests
    - unittest don't hit the database
- fixtures
- e2e
- postman
- openAPI

Some scouting:
- names: get/list
- order in functions CLGUD + MISC
- repositories to async
